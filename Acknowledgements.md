## ASCII soccer

The ASCII soccer environment that was published under
the GPL is included partially in this distribution as
the foundation for an example. The full distribution
of ASCII soccer can be downloaded from 

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/soccer/

The GPL does not extend to CABSL, because ASCII soccer
is only used as an example and programs developed with
CABSL do not need to include any files from the ASCII 
soccer distribution.

Thanks to Tucker Balch for developing ASCII soccer.

## XABSL

CABSL is heavily inspired by XABSL developed by Martin
Lötzsch, Max Risler, and Matthias Jüngel. The original
XABSL distribution can be downloaded from

http://www.xabsl.de

The example provided here is a port of their ASCII 
soccer client that was originally written in XABSL to
CABSL. The example code was originally written by 
Martin Lötzsch. Its port is only a demonstration and 
programs developed with CABSL do not need to include
any files from the XABSL/CABSL example.

Thanks to Martin Lötzsch, Max Risler, and Matthias
Jüngel for developing XABSL.

## B-Human

CABSL is also part of the B-Human code releases. To
version provided in this distribution has been 
decoupled from B-Human's streaming architecture, but
it is otherwise identical. The B-Human code releases
can be accessed from their homepage at

https://www.b-human.de

Thanks to all B-Human team members from providing a
basis for developing CABSL.
