Preamble: B-Human releases most of the software it uses at RoboCup
competitions to allow teams participating in the Standard Platform
League that do not have the resources to develop a complete robot
soccer system on their own, but still have important contributions
to make to the goals of RoboCup. We intend to enable such teams to
benchmark their own scientific approaches in RoboCup competitions.
We also hope that the scientific community will benefit from their
work through the publication of their findings.
A second reason for B-Human releasing its code is that source code
is the most solid documentation of how problems were actually
solved.
