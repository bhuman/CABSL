/**
 * @InFileStream.h
 *
 * Helper class for reading configuration files of options.
 * It is based on `std::ifstream`, i.e. all values that should
 * be read must be streamable with that class. In case of an
 * error, an exception is thrown. Unfortunately, this simple
 * implementation does not provide helpful error messages.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Assume the following declaration:
 *
 *     option(AnOption, load((int) anIntValue,
 *                           (float) aFloatValue)) {...
 *
 * Then, a file with the name "AnOption.cfg" must exist in
 * current directory, containing data such as this:
 *
 *      anIntValue: 17
 *      aFloatValue: 3.14
 *
 * There must be a newline present after each line.
